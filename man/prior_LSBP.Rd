\usage{
prior_LSBP(
  p_kernel,
  p_mixing,
  b_kernel = rep(0, p_kernel),
  B_kernel = diag(10^6, p_kernel),
  b_mixing = rep(0, p_mixing),
  B_mixing = diag(10^4, p_mixing),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{p_kernel, p_mixing}{The dimension of the design matrices for the kernel component and the mixing component, respectively.}

\item{b_kernel}{A \code{p_kernel} dimensional vector representing the prior mean for the  Gaussian kernel coefficients.}

\item{B_kernel}{A \code{p_kernel x p_kernel} matrix representing the prior covariance of the  Gaussian kernel coefficients.}

\item{b_mixing}{A \code{p_mixing} dimensional vector containing the prior mean of the Gaussian mixing coefficients.}

\item{B_mixing}{A \code{p_mixing x p_mixing} matrix representing the prior covariance  of the Gaussian mixing coefficients.}

\item{a_tau, b_tau}{The hyperparameters of a Gamma prior distribution for the kernel precision.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list having the same entries provided as argument. Missing arguments are filled with default values, although this is NOT recommended in general.
}
\description{
This auxiliary function can be used for specifying the prior hyperparameters in the \code{\link[LSBP]{LSBP_Gibbs}}, \code{\link[LSBP]{LSBP_ECM}}, \code{\link[LSBP]{LSBP_VB}} main functions.
